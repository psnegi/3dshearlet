function rec = PrySDrec_onestep(Lp, Hp, w, tbw, D, smooth_func)

%   N-dimensional multiscale pyramid reconstruction - One Step
%
%   INPUT:
%
%   Lp: the lowpass subband in the Fourier domain with the symmetric part
%   removed along the last dimension.
%
%   Hp: the highpass subband in the Fourier domain with the symmetric part
%   removed along the last dimension.
%  
%   w: The ideal cutoff frequency of the lowpass subband. w is specified as a
%   fraction of PI, e.g. 0.5, 1/3, ....
%
%   tbw: Width of the transition band, specified as a fraction of PI.
%
%   D: downsampling factor. For example, 1, 1.5, 2, ......
%   Note: D should divide the size of the FFT array.
%
%   smooth_func: function handle to generate the smooth passband theta
%   function
%
%   OUTPUT:
%
%   rec: the reconstructed signal in the Fourier domain. Note: Since the signal is
%   real-vaued in the spatial domain, we remove the symmetric part of rec 
%   along the last dimension to save computation time. This is important 
%   when rec is a large 3-D array. See ccsym.m for details.
