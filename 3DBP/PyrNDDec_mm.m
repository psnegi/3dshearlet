%   N-dimensional multiscale pyramid decomposition - with multiple modes
%
%   INPUT:
%
%   X: input signal in the spatial domain
%  
%   OutD: "S" if we want the output to be a usual signal in the spatial "F" if
%   we are want it to be in the Fourier domain. 
%   We use this to get rid of the unnecessary (and time-consuming)
%   "ifftn-fftn" operations in the middle steps.
%
%   L: level of decomposition
%
%   Pyr_mode: Decomposition modes, including 1 (do not downsample the first
%   lowpass), 1.5 (downsample the first lowpass by 1.5), 2 (use a lowpass
%   with 1/3 PI cutoff frequency)
%
%   smooth_func: function handle to generate the smooth passband theta
%   function
%
%   OUTPUT:
%
%   subs: an L+1 by 1 cell array storing subbands from the finest scale to
%   the coarsest scale.
